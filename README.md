# JSON Schema Documentation Generator

It generates HTML documentation for a JSON format from a JSON schema. Written in Ruby because I wanted to figure the languge out, and because there isn't a good schema documentation generator that I could get to work.  ~~also i havent read the json schema specification so this might not work exactly as it should~~
